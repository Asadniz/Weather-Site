# Weather-Site

The following task is part of my internship for Prodigy Infotech. The task was to construct a weather website that fetches data from an API displays the current temperature, real feel, and other relevant quantities. Apart from that, the website should also show the forecast for the coming 5 days.  I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this. As for the API, I used the one provided by 'weatherAPI.com'. Styling this website was quite a fascinating task, as I like working on stylesheets.\
